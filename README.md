## Introduction to Data Analytics

Data Analytics involves the extraction of meaningful insights from raw data to aid decision-making. Python is a powerful programming language widely used in the field of data analytics due to its rich ecosystem of libraries.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

## Data Wrangling with Pandas

[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is a powerful data manipulation library for Python. Learn how to clean, transform, and analyze data using Pandas.

## Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn

[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) are essential libraries for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

## Statistical Analysis

Understand statistical concepts and perform basic statistical analysis on datasets. Learn how to interpret results and draw meaningful conclusions.

## Machine Learning Basics

Introduce yourself to machine learning concepts using Python's [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/). Explore simple machine learning algorithms for classification and regression.

## Project Examples

Apply your data analytics skills to real-world projects:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze a dataset, draw insights, and create visualizations.
2. **Predictive Modeling:** Build a simple machine learning model to predict outcomes based on historical data.
